                <p>Surrounded by smoke and inspired by the communities’ resilience,
                    our design team reimagined the CaliforniaGrizzly and used it to create custom tees, pins and

                <h2>The Golden Bear</h2>
                <p>his design is all about the resilience of California to overcome difficult situations and come out
                    stronger than before.
                    It’s a flip of the UNC Tarheel mascot with added elements like the California poppy.</p>
